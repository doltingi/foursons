						<h2>Making/Bottling Your Wine</h2>
						<p>The reason why our wine is so reasonably priced is because you are making your own wine. The process of making your wine is full of fun with good memories. All you have to do is: add yeast to the grape juice, then put the finished wine into the bottle (we will contact you when the wine is ready) and finally enjoy the wine that you have made with your own hands!</p>
